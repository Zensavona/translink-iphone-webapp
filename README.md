# Translink Journey Planner App

## What
Because I'm pedantic, I've fixed Translink's journey planner 'app' so that when I save it to my home screen it behaves as I want it to (there is no `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` by default). I've just made an iFrame of the page and fiddled with it a little bit. Pretty quick and dirty, it only took a few minutes. Take a look at `public/journeyplanner.html` the rest is junk to make Heroku happy.

## How
If you feel my pain and would like to use it just deploy it on a free Heroku instance, navigate there and add it to your homescreen!

## If you're from Translink
If you're from Translink and you want to/have fixed your app or I've made you mad, send me an email or tweet me! I'd love to talk.
